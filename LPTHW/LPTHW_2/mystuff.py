""" 
Classes are like blueprints or definitions for creating new mini-modules.
Instantiation is how you make one of these mini-modules and import it at the same time. "Instantiate" just means to create an object from the class.
The resulting created mini-module is called an object and you then assign it to a variable to work with it.
